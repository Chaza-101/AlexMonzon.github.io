	<h1>The Rules.</h1>
	<h2>While not very strict, there are key features that are often represented in the frutiger aesthetics</h2>
  <header>
  <main>

	<div id="grid">
	<div id="line">
	<h3>Skewmorphized UX/UI</h3>
	<p>One of the best examples of this is the Wii, where the game icons are not only spaced out, but when you hover on them they would expand and make a noise, indicating that it is clickable. 
	Things looked more like their intended purpose, and with the rise of technology usage, the need to have as much skeuomorphism in ux declined. 
	I however still think it's really nice to interact with because it gives a clear guide on how people are supposed to use software without needing previous internet experience.</p>
	</div>

	<div id="line">
	<h3>Glossy Design</h3>
	<p>All of the Fruitiger aesthetics have this sleek "perfection" to them, where the designs look like they are shiny or made of glass. 
	All of the images are also extremely crisp unless purposefully diffused. 
	While I think this was so they showed up correctly on lower-resolution screens at the time, it gives it a creative touch now. 
	From looking at reference images,  a lot of the shine to them seems to be easily replicable in Photoshop with either lasso tools and Gaussian blur to create the shine, or a gradient from the center out.</p>
	</div>

	<div id="Eline">
	<h3>Frutiger typefaces</h3>
	<p>Before starting this research, I assumed there was no directly linked font that went with this aesthetic. 
	Come to my surprise to find out it is named after Adrian Frutiger, a well-known typeface designer. 
	The humanist sans-serif designs he created and this aesthetic follows have stronger curves than regular sans-serif, seem more handwritten, and are known for their strong legibility, even from afar. 
	Along with that, there are fonts that repeatedly show up in designs like Droid Sans, Calibri, Fruitiger, Myriad, and Segoe.</p>
	</div>

	</div>

	<p>This family of aesthetics have a lot of other big stylistic choices that group them together. 
	For example, a lot of them share color palates, mainly going for blues, greens, and other cool toned colors. 
	This to me is really interesting, because a lot of the other stylistic elements seem to imply that a better color aesthetic would be warmer toned colors, but the times I've seen it done its ugly. 
	I also find it interesting how a lot of these aesthetics choose to break these color rules and it works. Four colors and Frutiger Metro both often break these color rules, going for pinks and oranges more often than not.</p>

	<div id="grid">
	<figure><img src="img/fish.png"></figure>

	<p id="line2">And the 2D sub-aesthetics often break the gloss rules too, since they're 2D. 
	They still keep the idea of a sparkle, using flairs in different ways. Metro does this with loops, graffiti and musical elements. 
	Four colors goes more corporate, and just uses people silhouettes as its main flair and focus.</p>

	<p id="Eline2">While we're on the point of rule breaking, NONE OF THE MAIN THINGS USE THE FRUTIGER FONT. 
	Its absolutely crazy. Half of these companies made their own boring font, and the other half use like,, Roboto or Arial. 
	absolutely insane that the font is right there and unused.</p>
