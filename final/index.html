	<h1>What is Frutiger?</h1>
	<h2>An exploratory website</h2>
  <header>

  <main>
  <div id="grid">
	<p id="line">The story starts way in the past though, with Adrian Frutiger in 1976. 
	He created the font Frutiger, a humanist sans-serif typeface with a focus on legibility from distances. 
	While most Frutiger designs in modern age don't use his fonts, it's important to remember the roots.</p>
	
	<p id="line">The aesthetics started as a user experience style, and it was helpful in creating a simple and well organized technology that a large
	audience would understand intuitively. 
	It was mainly implemented by Windows, but its effect has been felt in throughout the design sphere.</p>
	
	<p id="Eline">While it's time on the internet was short lived, people (me) still find it fascinating, with a recent boom in people creating and designing their personal websites, along with sharing parts of this aesthetic online. 
	Hopefully this revival brings it back for good, and evolves it for the better.</p>

	<!-- DESKTOP ONLY -->
  <div id="desktop">
	<p>This website is an exploration of these ideas and concepts, trying to figure out what to do with them in a modern internet. 
	I document  A LOT of mistakes I make, and the conclusions I reach about these mistakes. 
	This aesthetic has a sense of nostalgia to me that really affects the designs I make, because I think its so impactful. 
	For example, last semester I made a redesign of the website G.URL. It has a lot of those same Y2K elements (Closer to Frutiger Metro, explored in this site if you click around :P) and it made curious about these types of websites.</p>
	
	<p>So many things have gone wrong during this project JESUS. 
	I tried to make this using Three.js and,, Yeah. I forgot I'm not the best at coding, and that im not the best at doing this kind of project. 
	I learnt about using P5.js too late to make it a super big part of the project, so I had to for the most part scrap my goals of having 3D elements be the iconic focus of this site. 
	I think the research I did on this page for a lot of this was really cool, but I maybe needed to remember my skill level more frequently during this. 
	Even as I'm writing this I have no clue how the code is going to turn out so please pray. 
	All of the collage thingy's for this app were made using pngwing.com's free commercial free photos and graphics.</p>

  <header>
	<h1>Key Aesthetics.</h1>
	<h2>Frutiger Aero/Aurora</h2>
  <header>
  <main> 
	<p>Aero is the most well known of the styles. 
	It has very interesting idyllic, photoshopped, glossy elements as its main art, and the key elements are a combination of nature and technology, with blue and green as its main two colors. 
	One of its most well know implementations is one of the Windows 95 backgrounds. 
	Because of its connection to the Windows products, their old style of UX/UI was deeply rooted in skewmorphism, and it gave computers a lot of the skewmorphic detailing it still has now.</p>
  
	<p>Aurora also has a long history of backgrounds, even till now. 
	The main focus of this style is looking similar to Aurora Borealis. 
	However as research has continued I'm realizing its more of just the concept of an aurora, with it just being sort of just fun gradient lines and shapes. 
	I think this idea has stuck around even into now, with a lot of the default backgrounds being just gradient lines and shapes.</p>

	<p id="Eline">I think in the modern day a lot of these ideas have stuck, but have evolved and toned down. 
	An interesting direction to go in would be bringing back the more skeomorphic details that have been slowly flattened down, and having the background elements as more of a 3d background experience seems very interesting to me. 
	I also saw a way to be able to click and move things around the screen using jquery, and I feel like that also fits into bringing this aesthetic back into things.</p>
  </main>
  </div>

  <div class="metro">
  <header>
	<h2>Frutiger Metro</h2>
  <header>
  <main>
	<p>Frutiger Metro (also known as flat Frutiger Aero) uses the Metro design method created by Microsoft, that they still use today. 
	It keeps a lot of the same key elements of nature and natural movements with a gloss, but in a different way. 
	It does a lot of vine and flower elements instead, and chooses to steer away from the false realism of other Frutiger aesthetics. 
	It also has a lot of musical elements involved, with speakers and circle sound balls, and even depicts people often. 
	It is usually very restrained in its color choices, but that is really depending on the type of sub-sub-genre it is. 
	It also has a lot of graffiti elements involved, with the spray texture and bold shapes being clear inspirations.</p>
  
	<p id="Eline">p>The reason I find this important to include in the research is because as of the last few years, Y2k aesthetics have been returning into fashion and music, and I feel like there is a lot of overlap between some of the features in this aesthetic and current returning trends. 
	I am still unsure as to how it will be implemented into the website, but maybe a tab for music related things with this aesthetic, because it feels wrong to talk about how to bring Frutiger back without mentioning it.</p>

	</div>
  </main>



  <header>
	<h1>The Rules.</h1>
	<h2>While not very strict, there are key features that are often represented in the frutiger aesthetics</h2>
  <header>
  <main>
	<div class="modern">

	<h3>Skewmorphized UX/UI</h3>
	<div>
	<p>One of the best examples of this is the Wii, where the game icons are not only spaced out, but when you hover on them they would expand and make a noise, indicating that it is clickable. 
	Things looked more like their intended purpose, and with the rise of technology usage, the need to have as much skeuomorphism in ux declined. 
	I however still think it's really nice to interact with because it gives a clear guide on how people are supposed to use software without needing previous internet experience.</p>
	</div>

	
	<h3>Glossy Design</h3>
	<div>
	<p>All of the Fruitiger aesthetics have this sleek "perfection" to them, where the designs look like they are shiny or made of glass. 
	All of the images are also extremely crisp unless purposefully diffused. 
	While I think this was so they showed up correctly on lower-resolution screens at the time, it gives it a creative touch now. 
	From looking at reference images,  a lot of the shine to them seems to be easily replicable in Photoshop with either lasso tools and Gaussian blur to create the shine, or a gradient from the center out.</p>
	</div>

	
	<h3>Frutiger typefaces</h3>
	<div>
	<p>Before starting this research, I assumed there was no directly linked font that went with this aesthetic. 
	Come to my surprise to find out it is named after Adrian Frutiger, a well-known typeface designer. 
	The humanist sans-serif designs he created and this aesthetic follows have stronger curves than regular sans-serif, seem more handwritten, and are known for their strong legibility, even from afar. 
	Along with that, there are fonts that repeatedly show up in designs like Droid Sans, Calibri, Fruitiger, Myriad, and Segoe.</p>
	</div>

  </div>
  </main>


  <header>
	<h1>Modernize.</h1>
	<h2>Throughout the website design, there are several attempts to try to modernize the aesthetic, while still keeping the base elements.</h2>
  <header>
  <main>

  <div class="modern">

	<h3>Bento-Box Designs</h3>
	<div>
	<p>These types of designs feel very reminiscent of the old style of designs, where the layouts where complicated and boxy, but seemed human. 
	The bento box designs use flexbox to do so, it makes it interactive and easy to resize compared to older designs. Even now, companies like Apple use it in their design to show off products, it fills up space well. </p>
	
	<p>I tried to show this in the Rules of Style tab, and I think I did well on it, but I think I could've filled space more efficiently, and it still feels a bit too basic. 
	That is truly the hardest part about this aesthetic, you do too much and it feels wrong and off, but if you don't do enough it feels empty and bland. 
	I think the appeal of the bento box designs are how easy to fill they are without being cluttered and wrong. </p>
	</div>

	
	<h3>Glossy Design</h3>
	<div>
	<p>I think in the past few years, there has been a return of Y2k and fun artistic elements from this era. 
	They really seem to be the backbone of what is keeping these aesthetics (Which didn't even have a name until 2017) alive and well, and its really interesting to see.</p>

	<p>Below are some of my own explorations of the aesthetic, and also the exploration of fellow students (credits below). 
	It's really interesting to see how different people explore this aesthetic, and how we can implement the aesthetics that worked so well in the past today.</p>
	</div>

	
	<h3>3D Elements</h3>
	<div>
	<p>3d elements are such an interesting way to bring back the same type of aesthetic elements that are prevalent in the Frutiger aesthetics, and that are cool functions in web today.</P>
	
	<p>I really did try. 
	But I ran into so many issues trying to use 3D implementors like three.js and Spline, that I had to cut my losses. 
	I made 3D elements in blender that I have embed into the site, but there I wasn't able to get some of the work I did in. 
	It's fine, whatever didn't make it into the design elements is underneath here as experiments and tests that lead to this site.</p>

	<p>I think the roadblocks with these kind of elements are how dependent they still are on JavaScript, so if you don't know what you're doing and just want to make pretty things its basically impossible.</p>
