	<h2>Frutiger Aero/Aurora</h2>
  <header>

  <main> 
	<p>Aero is the most well known of the styles. 
	It has very interesting idyllic, photoshopped, glossy elements as its main art, and the key elements are a combination of nature and technology, with blue and green as its main two colors. 
	One of its most well know implementations is one of the Windows 95 backgrounds. 
	Because of its connection to the Windows products, their old style of UX/UI was deeply rooted in skewmorphism, and it gave computers a lot of the skewmorphic detailing it still has now.</p>
  
	<p>Aurora also has a long history of backgrounds, even till now. 
	The main focus of this style is looking similar to Aurora Borealis. 
	However as research has continued I'm realizing its more of just the concept of an aurora, with it just being sort of just fun gradient lines and shapes. 
	I think this idea has stuck around even into now, with a lot of the default backgrounds being just gradient lines and shapes.</p>

	<p>I think in the modern day a lot of these ideas have stuck, but have evolved and toned down. 
	An interesting direction to go in would be bringing back the more skeomorphic details that have been slowly flattened down, and having the background elements as more of a 3d background experience seems very interesting to me. 
	I also saw a way to be able to click and move things around the screen using jquery, and I feel like that also fits into bringing this aesthetic back into things.</p>
	<button> Metro </button>
  </main>
  </div>

  <header>

<div id="metro">
	<h2>Frutiger Metro</h2>
  <header>
  <main>
	<p>Frutiger Metro (also known as flat Frutiger Aero) uses the Metro design method created by Microsoft, that they still use today. 
	It keeps a lot of the same key elements of nature and natural movements with a gloss, but in a different way. 
	It does a lot of vine and flower elements instead, and chooses to steer away from the false realism of other Frutiger aesthetics. 
	It also has a lot of musical elements involved, with speakers and circle sound balls, and even depicts people often. 
	It is usually very restrained in its color choices, but that is really depending on the type of sub-sub-genre it is. 
	It also has a lot of graffiti elements involved, with the spray texture and bold shapes being clear inspirations.</p>
  
	<p>The reason I find this important to include in the research is because as of the last few years, Y2k aesthetics have been returning into fashion and music, and I feel like there is a lot of overlap between some of the features in this aesthetic and current returning trends. 
	I am still unsure as to how it will be implemented into the website, but maybe a tab for music related things with this aesthetic, because it feels wrong to talk about how to bring Frutiger back without mentioning it.</p>
