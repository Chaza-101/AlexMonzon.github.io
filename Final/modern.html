	<h2>Throughout the website design, there are several attempts to try to modernize the aesthetic, while still keeping the base elements.</h2>

	<h3>Bento-Box Designs</h3>
	<p>These types of designs feel very reminiscent of the old style of designs, where the layouts where complicated and boxy, but seemed human. 
	The bento box designs use flexbox to do so, it makes it interactive and easy to resize compared to older designs. Even now, companies like Apple use it in their design to show off products, it fills up space well. </p>
	
	<p>I tried to show this in the Rules of Style tab, and I think I did well on it, but I think I could've filled space more efficiently, and it still feels a bit too basic. 
	That is truly the hardest part about this aesthetic, you do too much and it feels wrong and off, but if you don't do enough it feels empty and bland. 
	I think the appeal of the bento box designs are how easy to fill they are without being cluttered and wrong. </p>

	<h3>Retro/Gloss Elements</h3>
	<p>I think in the past few years, there has been a return of Y2k and fun artistic elements from this era. 
	They really seem to be the backbone of what is keeping these aesthetics (Which didn't even have a name until 2017) alive and well, and its really interesting to see.</p>

	<p>Below are some of my own explorations of the aesthetic, and also the exploration of fellow students (credits below). 
	It's really interesting to see how different people explore this aesthetic, and how we can implement the aesthetics that worked so well in the past today.</p>
	</div>

	<div id="Eline">
	<h3>3D Elements</h3>
	<p>3d elements are such an interesting way to bring back the same type of aesthetic elements that are prevalent in the Frutiger aesthetics, and that are cool functions in web today.</P>
	
	<p>I really did try. 
	But I ran into so many issues trying to use 3D implementors like three.js and Spline, that I had to cut my losses. 
	I made 3D elements in blender that I have embed into the site, but there I wasn't able to get some of the work I did in. 
	It's fine, whatever didn't make it into the design elements is underneath here as experiments and tests that lead to this site.</p>

	<p>I think the roadblocks with these kind of elements are how dependent they still are on JavaScript, so if you don't know what you're doing and just want to make pretty things its basically impossible.</p>
